### Rust for backend

High performant, reliable ant type safe backend service with Rust.

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) is a great and super powerful modern system language 
(Think about the performance of backend service written in C).

**Build**: Backend service with Rust + gRPC + protocol buffers. 
gRPC + protocol buffers will guarantee type safety across all API clients. 

**Tech stack:** Rust +  gRPC + protocol buffers.

**Benchmark:** Against Node version of the service.

### Cross-platform mobile development 

I'm completely agree with: 
> We think React Native fits really well for API-driven apps, where the user interface then stays relatively static after the initial load of data. There are amazing JavaScript tools like React, Relay, Jest and Styled Components that help you only really write the domain specific code you need to write and then things like GraphQL and TypeScript which gives you strict contracts with your API's data. - [artsy](http://artsy.github.io/series/react-native-at-artsy/)

**Build**: Generic app (i.e. photos discovery) with Native (Swift/Kotlin), React Native and Flutter.

**Tech stack:** Swift/Kotlin, React Native(TypeScript) and Flutter.

**Benchmark:** Performance of huge collections, lines of code, time.
